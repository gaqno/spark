| [.npmrc](https://github.com/gaqno/ancora_sys/blob/main/.npmrc)                         | The provided code snippet sets two configurations for the development environment. It sets `shamefully-hoist` to true, implying that dependencies can be hoisted to a higher level. `strict-peer-dependencies` is set to false, indicating flexibility in resolving peer dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                             |

The layout includes a ModalComponent that is displayed if the "show" property in the app store is true. It also includes a LoadingComponent that is displayed if the "loading" property in the app store is true. The NuxtPage component is always rendered. The script section imports the app store and global styles and sets the document title. The style section includes CSS transitions for opacity animations. |
| [global.d.ts](https://github.com/gaqno/ancora_sys/blob/main/global.d.ts)               | The provided code snippet configures and expands the functionalities of the Pinia state management library. It removes the suffix from map store names, creates a Pinia instance, and customizes the suffix for map stores. It also declares modules for'vue-csv-import' and "*.vue" to provide compatible imports with Vue.js components.                                                                                                                         |
